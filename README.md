Skill Finder is a tool to automatically find and publish skills and expertise for an individual. Other tools like LinkedIn and Delve enable users to manually submit this data, however this leads to inconsistant and out of date data. We want to fix this, and as a result, improve existing applications which take advantage of this data.
